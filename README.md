## Working on the layout
Trying to improve my css skills by building (hopefully) many layouts. Details are not as important.

I draw a lot of inspiration from greate Hayden Pickering (every layout), Andy Bell (cube) and books like Css in Depth as well Master CSS very impressed with [this article](https://tiffanybbrown.com/2022/01/how-does-flexbox-work/index.html)

I'm trying to improve my thinking framework, and produce systems instead of micro manage and mix concurnes. 

Looking my attempts in this layout you can look at gap's that works around tiles & navigations that are controlable with one variables. Or look at sidebar/Main interaction that first works without media query's and seconds I attempted to split layout concurnes from styles.

I make a lot of mistakes with em's and rem's in that kind of env, since I noticed it's hard to make one variable that's in `em` responsible for sizing if that sizing is depending on another contexts.I had this problem with sidebar links when I was using negative margins and needed to offset with padding.
