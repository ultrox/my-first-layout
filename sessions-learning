A) I'm missing a mental framework
B) I didn't do enough of those

Questions I always have:
- Do I use rem's here or px on this specific element
- Do I set a fixed height for this nav component and then micromanage it with media queries or let it be sized by content
	- this depends on the context
- How much defensive do I need to be


## Understunding
- Mental framework of em
- Greate explanation pros and cons of using tag selector as the last selector
- Build stuff twice
(It's not how long it took you to create it the first time, to build it, but how long it took you to create it the second time)
