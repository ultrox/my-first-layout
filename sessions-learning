A) I'm missing a mental framework
B) I didn't do enough of those

Questions I always have:
- Do I use rem's here or px on this specific element
- Do I set a fixed height for this nav component and then micromanage it with media queries or let it be sized by content
	- this depends on the context
- How much defensive do I need to be


## Understunding
- Mental framework of em
- Greate explanation pros and cons of using tag selector as the last selector
- Build stuff twice
(It's not how long it took you to create it the first time, to build it, but how long it took you to create it the second time)


## Problems

### Type scale
* I don't have intuition about typo or/and scale at all, very visible when I was setting up typographi and size for it.

* I know I have 7 scales starting from p, h6..h1 I had a problem
That The scale didn't really fit the design

* What would be best aproach here?
Do I go and make the scale fit, or do I get the best 
I can and then override?
Good examples are those titles that are the same size(but bold) as p text


- If I use title on a elements do I need aria-label, this is for links that
	have not children as text, but icons?
- How can I hide that X button when target is open
