### Expectation

I don't think I'll have major problems here with this layout, only thing that could be tricky:

- hamburger menu on mobile
- tabs for roadmaps


## Preparation

Few stuff I needed to adjust before starting, mainly smaller things in designs:

- Normaized colors in HSL format
	Some colors had very similar hue but few degree difference that eye coulding see (my eye at least)
- Icons: I just found all the icons accross the mockup and adjusted them to fit
	on 20x20 frame & small adjustment of actuall icons size so it's easier to work with them.
